![A flow chart of the data analysis pipeline of Tigmint. Inputs files are shown in parallelograms. Intermediate steps are shown in rectangles. Output files are shown in ellipses. File formats are indicated in parentheses. The optional steps of scaffolding and aligning to a reference genome to compute assembly metrics are shown in a dashed rectangle.](figures/pipeline.png){#fig:pipeline}
